# Dev Landing Page

Minimal landing page for developers.

Developers don't talk much. Their code does all the talking. So here's a minimal landing page for developers.

## Use

This originallyb started as me just wanting to make a cool looking portfolio page but ended up even better when I found a very basic simple template that allowed me to expand on it massively. I wanted a dev landing page to showcase everything I do online and I wanted it to be minimal, beautiful and right to the point rather and hefty. And I think most of the devs out there would want the same.

As I said this is not my own work but is a fork, if you are the original creator kindly contact me and i'll attribute. As is the website has been heavily modified to suit my taste and will continue recieving upgrades until I come up with something better.

## Themes

Dev Landing Page comes in 9 **material themes** but only one is currently being developed.

If none of these themes fit within your taste, it's quite easy to customize and create your own too.

## GitHub Pages

GitHub makes it easy to create personal websites. Follow this link - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to know how or follow the steps below.

If you already have a GitHub profile (obviously)

* Create a new repo with the name `{username}.github.io`
* Clone/Fork this repo and copy the files to your newly created repo
* Customize your name, links and everything else for your landing page
* `git push`

Voila! Your site should be live at `https://{username}.github.io`

### Custom Domain
